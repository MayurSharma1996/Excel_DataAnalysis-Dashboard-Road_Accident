# Excel_DataAnalysis-Dashboard-Road_Accident

[Click this link of Road Accident Data in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LtI7HCon89x-ZyU_pC1cfK3dr4AMMvSvgLQ5520v1X8/edit?usp=sharing)

The original Excel File of 'Road Accident Data' is 54 MB after compression. So, I can't upload from my PC directly to GitHub due to file size limitations.
I have added two screenshots of the dashboard and KPI to be referred to in case of a distorted view in the Google sheet.
